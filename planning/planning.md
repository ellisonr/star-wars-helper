Star Wars Helper
================

## Why Star Wars?

This app could be useful for someone like my brother. He’s tried to get me into Star Wars for forever. I would ask a lot of questions while watching. With this app, he could just enter in a character, film, or vehicle and have the answers at his fingertips.

## Basic flow for using the app

###### The following is just an example of a scenario
This app (assuming a front end would eventually be built for it) would allow a user to enter a character’s (first model) name, which would then display information about said character. This information would include: name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birthday, etc. It would also indicate which films (second model) said character has appeared in. Lastly, it would also indicate which vehicles/starships (third model) said character has piloted.
